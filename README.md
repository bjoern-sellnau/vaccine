Vaccine
=======

For an introduction to Vaccine, check out [www.vaccinejs.com](http://www.vaccinejs.com)!

Some things that the intro doesn't cover:

You can also install vaccine with npm with `npm install -g vaccine`. That way
you don't need to copy from the website. Run `vaccine --help` for info on
the options.

In case it wasn't clear in the intro, you can develop with separate script
tags, like so:

```html
<!-- Must be before sources -->
<script src="/vaccine_dev.js"></script>

<!-- Sources can be in any order -->
<script src="/src/underscore.js"></script>
<script src="/src/underscore/arrays.js"></script>
<script src="/src/underscore/collections.js"></script>
<script src="/src/underscore/each.js"></script>
<script src="/src/underscore/functions.js"></script>
<script src="/src/underscore/objects.js"></script>
<script src="/src/underscore/utils.js"></script>

<!-- Get the main exports with "requireDev()" -->
<script>_ = requireDev();</script>
```

You can also use the `dev_server.js` to wrap CommonJS modules for the
browser.
